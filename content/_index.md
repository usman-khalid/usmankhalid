Hello — I'm Usman Khalid, a developer based out of Ontario, Canada. I'm currently working as a Sr. AEM Engineer at [Adobe](https://adobe.com), primarily working on [Edge Delivery Services](https://aem.live). I enjoy lighthouse scores above 99, accessible navigations and simplicity in general.

Occasionally, I [write](/posts).
