Hello — I'm Usman Khalid, a developer based out of Ontario, Canada. I'm currently working as a front-end lead at [Bounteous](https://bounteous.com), primarily working with Adobe Experience Manager and helping large companies build digital experiences.

Occasionally, I [write](/posts) about development & AEM.
 
Wanna connect? [Say hello](mailto:usman.khalid@live.ca).
