Hello — I'm Usman Khalid, a developer based out of Ontario, Canada. I'm currently working as an AEM/EDS Architect at [Adobe](https://adobe.com), helping customers build cool digital experiences. I enjoy lighthouse scores above 99, accessible navigations and simplicity in general.

Occasionally, I [write](/posts).
 
Let's chat. [Say hello](mailto:usman.khalid@live.ca).
