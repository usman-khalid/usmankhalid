title: Eater of food. Maker of things

Hello — I'm Usman Khalid, a developer based out of Ontario, Canada. I'm currently working as a Technical Architect at [Adobe](https://adobe.com), primarily building cool things with [Edge Delivery Services (EDS)](https://www.aem.live/) & AEM. I enjoy lighthouse scores above 99, accessible navigations and simplicity in general.

Occasionally, I [write](/posts).
