As far back as I can remember, I've always been interested in creating digital experiences. When I was in high school, I took a media communications class and decided to make a website for an assignment. I loved the idea of creating something that people could see, interact with and use online. I remember using layers in Adobe Dreamweaver to visually drag and drop elements on a page (not knowing that this was positioning everything absolutely and it would break outside of that specific screen size). It seems like a long time ago and technology has come a long way since then, but hopefully, I have as well.

When I'm not typing on a keyboard, I enjoy sports, music & food.

I live in Ontario with my wife and two sons.
