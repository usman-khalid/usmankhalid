      <description>Asset renditions are an important piece of the DAM in Adobe Experience Manager. Out of the box, AEM creates a few renditions for each asset that is uploaded. These can be used for different viewports and devices or as thumbnails. However, what if we wanted to create a blurred or grayscale rendition for an asset? These are some simple use cases, but with Adobeâ€™s asset compute service, we can extend the out of the box functionality to handle them and go even further to implement more complex scenarios.</description>

      <description>As far back as I can remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in creating experiences on the web. When I was in high school, I took a media communications class and decided to make a website for an assignment. I loved the idea of creating something that people could see, interact with and use online. I remember using Adobe Dreamweaver and using layers to visually drag and drop elements on a page (not knowing that this was positioning everything absolutely) and it would break outside of that specific screen size.</description>
