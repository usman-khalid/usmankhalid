      <description>As far back as I can remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in creating experiences on the web. When I was in high school, I took a media communications class and decided to make a website for an assignment. I loved the idea of creating something that people could see, interact with and use online. I remember using Adobe Dreamweaver and using layers to visually drag and drop elements on a page (not knowing that this was positioning everything absolutely) and it would break outside of that specific screen size.</description>
