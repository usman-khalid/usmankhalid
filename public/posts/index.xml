      <description>Asset renditions are an important piece of the DAM in Adobe Experience Manager. Out of the box, AEM creates a few renditions for each asset that is uploaded. These can be used for different viewports and devices or as thumbnails. However, what if we wanted to create a blurred or grayscale rendition for an asset? These are some simple use cases, but with Adobeâ€™s asset compute service, we can extend the out of the box functionality to handle them and go even further to implement more complex scenarios.</description>
